This package is more of a testing ground rather than something that
should be thought of as a "complete" product.  The main goal
is to provide a simple interface for viewing and manipulating data from the
bottom up with a focus on fast and easy access to the data.

Most of the focus here is quick virtual image generation and manipulation.
